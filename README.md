The “Grass Buddy” game is based on horizontal 2D shooter games with infinite scrolling backgrounds, but in this case the character does not shoot. The game as it is right now does not have levels, just one continuous round until there is no more lives.
The game's scope is to avoid obstacles by using up and down movements. 


In this repository you will find the following:
- code for the game mechanics
- resources for soundtracks, sound effects
- imagines for game's scene

- ALL THE ELEMENTS FROM THIS GAME ARE ORIGINALLY DRAW BY ME.
- This project is inspired by other 2D games I found online.
